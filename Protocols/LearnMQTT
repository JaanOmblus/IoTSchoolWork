MQTT is an OASIS standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT)

https://mqtt.org/

It is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices 
with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth.

MQTT is the most commonly used messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT).
MQTT stands for MQ Telemetry Transport. The protocol is a set of rules that defines how IoT devices can publish and subscribe to data over the Internet.

MQTT is fast becoming one of the main protocols for IOT (internet of things) deployments.

Because MQTT clients don’t have addresses like email addresses, phone numbers etc. you don’t need to assign addresses to clients like you do with most messaging systems.

For MQTTv3.1.1 there is client software available in almost all programming languages and for the main operating systems Linux, Windows, Mac from the Eclipse Paho project.

Websockets allows you to receive MQTT data directly into a web browser.
This is important as the web browser may become the DE-facto interface for displaying MQTT data.
MQTT websocket support for web browsers is provided by the Javascript MQTT Client.

MQTT supports various authentications and data security mechanisms.
It is important to note that these security mechanisms are configured on the MQTT broker, and it is up to the client to comply with the mechanisms in place.
