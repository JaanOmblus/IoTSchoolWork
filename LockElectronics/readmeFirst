We have devoted great deal of energy to get doorlock electronics working properly and to be connected to programming part.

This is important for us because in real life we are constructing the gate to be openable with this type of system. 

The present undertaking is connected to "LockProject" presented under different subfolder of this portfolio.

See attached photos of the success.
