Node-RED is nice software, instructor introduced, sold nicely it to us.  We like it!

The main problem is you cannot access it, at least not in normal way, got to use this "apple-pie" stuff.  Try to figure out how to access in normal way.

Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.

Node-RED provides a browser-based flow editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette. 
Flows can be then deployed to the runtime in a single-click.

JavaScript functions can be created within the editor using a rich text editor.

A built-in library allows you to save useful functions, templates or flows for re-use.

Built on Node.js

The light-weight runtime is built on Node.js, taking full advantage of its event-driven, non-blocking model.
This makes it ideal to run at the edge of the network on low-cost hardware such as the Raspberry Pi as well as in the cloud.

The flows created in Node-RED are stored using JSON which can be easily imported and exported for sharing with others.
