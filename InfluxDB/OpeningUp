We really started to investigate time-series databases and in this particular case InfluxDB

Really nice way to arrange relational data in the fashion that primary key is timestamp.  Very logical and efficient way to manage IoT data.

We created small database for ourselves in InfluxDB, just to test it out and practice a bit.  Some screenshots are added to present cataloge.
