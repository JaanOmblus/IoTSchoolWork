We got two project ideas:

1. To change bulbs on electric lighting system of the enterprise, replace old "soviet heaters" with LED lamps.

2. To use LED ribbons to make scaling house to communicate information (blink, change color etc.) different processes.

The idea No 1 is easier to do and we start from this.

We have "soviet heater" and new type of LED lamp, both shown on the photos loaded into this catalogue.  Shown on different photos.  The smaller LED accompanied the
"soviet heater" is example of more efficient comparable example of led.

The caluculations show that just switching the bulbs will result 5% decrease of electricity bill of the company (considering all electricity consumption, not just bulbs).
Thus just bulb change results with considerable cross consumption savings effect.

This is really worthwhile project!

Thank you IoT class!
