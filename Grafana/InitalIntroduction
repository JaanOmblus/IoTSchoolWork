Grafana is nice environment and we took a good look at it.

It is different from Node-RED.  As of our understanding of the issue Node-RED connects directly to physical world and enables to combine physical "chips"
and the virtual environment, creating virtual pieces of the system which we do not have in real life.  Grafana does not do anything like this.  Grafana
is just to work with data, to visualize those data.  Very nice thing, but it does not replace Node-RED, however could nicely complement in certain setting.

The issue what we do not understand of Node-RED setup in our class is that why the access to the system should be such a tricky one, via Rasberry PI and accepting
just Delta network.  Why could not it be open to access?  Nice rescource is just blocked from wider usage.  Of course maybe there are other solutions to get
Node-RED running, other than taken in class, just need to take a look.

Attached some screenshots to the catalog here.
