IoTempower has nice resources available, really helpful resources.

Instructor has video on this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTWNYXfet9E

Services are available and listed here:
https://iotempire.net/service/

Very nice resource list is available at:
https://iotempire.net/resources/

The site is also available from:
https://iotempire.net/gw/#content
But the issue here is that actually you do not see a lot from general network, got to have the specific Rasberry PI

Another nice vide from instructor side:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcVJpXtSwPo

The useful address is:
https://iotempire.net/gw/nodered
But again, you need the Rasberry PI to see something from there.
